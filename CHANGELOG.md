# Changelog

## Fork notice — 2026-05-24, rebased 2026-09-29

This repository is `protoLabsAI/protoPatch`, a protoLabs-maintained fork of
`openclaw/clawpatch`. The CLI binary stays as `clawpatch` for downstream
compatibility; `protopatch` is also installed as an alias.

Up to 0.6.4 the fork was a long-lived divergence with its own version stream.
0.8.1 **rebases the fork onto upstream 0.8.1**: the version number now tracks the
upstream release the fork is built on. The fork's additions live in their own
adapter files (`src/providers/gateway.ts`, `src/providers/proto.ts`) instead of
inside the provider monolith, so upstream changes merge without conflict.

## 0.8.1 - Unreleased (protoLabs fork)

- Rebased onto upstream `openclaw/clawpatch` 0.8.1 (159 upstream commits): the
  provider split into `src/providers/*`, per-feature `review --feature-list`,
  hardened state writes and stale-lock reclaim, bounded revalidation prompts,
  committed-rename diff selection, mapper improvements, and the registry verifier.
- Re-homed the `gateway` and `proto` providers as adapters in the new layout, with
  all behaviour from 0.6.x kept: the undici agent that lifts the 300 s cutoff,
  retryable unusable replies with a shared call deadline, failure captures under
  `provider-failures/`, and the doubled-brace / leading-reasoning JSON recovery.
- Gateway and proto timeouts now use upstream's bounded `providerTimeoutMs`, so an
  oversized override falls back to the default instead of overflowing the timer.

## Upstream history (openclaw/clawpatch)

### 0.8.2 - Unreleased

- Fixed non-Git patch audits to retain symlink edits and literal backslashes in Unix filenames without reading linked targets.
- Fixed diff-scoped review, CI, and revalidation to include both paths of committed renames, preventing features mapped to the old path from being silently skipped.

### 0.8.1 - 2026-09-13

**Highlights:** Nested-project repairs stop tripping over sibling changes, and failed patch attempts keep the edits a provider already wrote.

- Fixed nested-project repairs to ignore their own state and sibling changes, fingerprint project-relative source paths, and record both sides of renames.
- Preserved observed source edits in failed patch attempts when a provider writes files before exiting with an error.
- Fixed `doctor` to honor standalone provider configuration before project initialization.
- Prevented oversized provider, validation, and PR-publishing timeout overrides from overflowing into one-millisecond deadlines.
- Rejected inherited object-property names as unsupported providers instead of failing during harness invocation.
- Completed Vitest 5 tooling with matching V8 coverage, a full-suite CI coverage run, ignored report artifacts, and documented development Node requirements while retaining Node 22/24/26 CI and the CLI's Node 22 floor.
- Updated Nano ID to 3.3.19, Magic String to 1.3.1, and Obug to 2.2.1 within the 48-hour dependency release-age policy.
- Updated Zod and development tooling, aligned Node typings with the Node 22 floor, and added Node 22/24 runtime CI with pinned GitHub Actions.
- Updated workflow and architecture docs to match current providers, explicit PR creation, validation order, and stale-lock recovery.

### 0.8.0 - 2026-09-07

**Highlights:** Opt-in HTTP context connects Node callers and Rust handlers during review.

- Added `map --link-http caller:backend` and `review --link-http caller:backend` for bounded, method-aware HTTP candidate context, with ambiguity checks and unchanged default feature records, thanks @Tanmay-008.
- Fixed source packaging with pnpm 12 by using the portable `pnpm run build` prepack command.
- Updated the pnpm GitHub Actions setup to 6.1.0.
- Added shared-host scheduling headroom to timeout regression tests while retaining explicit bounded-return checks.

### 0.7.3 - 2026-09-05

**Highlights:** Broader Rust module coverage and bounded timeouts for Go discovery and pull-request publishing.

- Added bounded Rust source-group slices under each Cargo package's `src/`, keeping command, library, and binary entrypoints on their existing features, thanks @joshuaboys.
- Fixed `clawpatch open-pr` so a stalled `git push` or `gh pr create` times out instead of hanging the command, thanks @SebTardif.
- Fixed Windows command timeouts so a hung `taskkill` cannot keep the CLI or its direct child running after the cleanup deadline, thanks @SebTardif.
- Fixed Windows shell validation commands with quoted executable paths.
- Fixed `clawpatch map` so a wedged `go list` times out and falls back to repository files, thanks @SebTardif.
- Reworked the README around a verified install and quickstart path, with deeper command, mapper, provider, and safety details linked to the existing docs.
- Updated Zod to 4.5.4 for lower-memory runtime schema validation.
- Updated pnpm, Node typings, formatter and linter tooling, Vitest 5/Vite, GitHub Actions dependencies, and the release workflow's npm CLI.
- Bound npm trusted publishing to the `npm-release` GitHub environment and restored canonical package repository metadata.

### 0.7.2 - 2026-08-01

- Reclaimed dead same-host review locks automatically and added `clean-locks --stale-only` for safe scripted cleanup while preserving live and remote locks, thanks @goutamadwant.
- Fixed diff-scoped review and CI runs to include changed features regardless of their previous review status, preventing warm-state gates from silently skipping changed code, thanks @youhaowei.
- Updated pnpm, Node typings, formatter and linter tooling, and security and repository automation actions.
- Added Rust seed context for Cargo manifests, paired crate entrypoints, and directly declared modules across crate roots and binary layouts, thanks @Tanmay-008.

### 0.7.1 - 2026-07-20

### Highlights

- Reduced mapper startup I/O by sharing one root file inventory across Go fallback, C/C++, and .NET mapping, thanks @Tanmay-008.
- Fixed revalidation prompts to compact historical and feature metadata and hard-cap metadata lists even when configured file limits are high, preventing provider input overflows, thanks @pai-scaffolde.
- Added an opt-in Claude host auth context that preserves the default-deny environment, uses Claude Code safe mode, validates auth through doctor, and reports redacted OAuth failure signals, thanks @grantjayy.

### 0.7.0 - 2026-06-15

- Removed the direct MiniMax HTTP provider and its transport dependency; provider integrations are now explicitly limited to coding harnesses and agent CLIs.
- Added uv workspace member mapping with repository-relative paths and member-local test commands while preserving mixed root source and test groups, thanks @srnm.
- Fixed uv workspace mapping to preserve root features with member-associated tests and include workspace-root runtime metadata in member features, thanks @srnm.

### 0.6.0 - 2026-06-11

- Added trusted Codex CLI config passthrough for explicit config files while rejecting repository-controlled passthrough config, thanks @brad-ai-agent.
- Added a MiniMax HTTP provider for `map`, `review`, and `revalidate`, with local schema validation and explicit unsupported `fix` handling, thanks @ferminquant.

### 0.5.1 - 2026-06-10

- Added npm trusted publishing through GitHub Actions OIDC, plus secops ownership, verified-secret scanning, and stale issue and pull request automation.
- Added opt-in npm registry verification that drops only matching single-package, whole-title-and-reasoning public-npm publication claims when the exact version is confirmed published, thanks @coletebou.
- Fixed revalidation to include linked patch attempts, validation results, feature context, and current relevant files so repaired findings can move out of `uncertain`.
- Added `clawpatch review --feature-list <path>` for reviewing an explicit ordered, de-duplicated set of feature IDs, thanks @camwest.

### 0.5.0 - 2026-05-31

- Added CUDA support to the C/C++ mapper, mapping `.cu` and `.cuh` sources as standalone `main()` files, CMake and autotools targets, legacy `FindCUDA` `cuda_add_executable` / `cuda_add_library` calls, and bounded loose source groups.
- Made `clawpatch review` and `clawpatch fix` CUDA-aware, injecting CUDA-specific guidance for features that own `.cu` or `.cuh` sources.
- Added shell and workflow review mapping for captured fallback-output ambiguity in command substitutions.
- Fixed Codex provider calls to time out stalled `codex exec` children and release review locks, thanks @camwest.
- Fixed Claude provider auth isolation to pass explicit Vertex AI, Google ADC, and Bedrock/AWS auth environment variables, thanks @zanetworker.
- Fixed Python review prompts to include target runtime metadata and avoid flagging Python 3.14 syntax such as PEP 758 exception handlers as invalid, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed mapper-generated validation commands to quote repository-derived paths, package names, script names, and test paths before shell execution, thanks @rohitjavvadi.

## protoLabs fork history before the rebase (fork numbering)

### 0.6.4 - Unreleased (protoLabs fork)

- **provider(gateway)**: a gateway call is no longer cut off at 300 s. Node's
  built-in `fetch` runs on undici's default Agent, whose `headersTimeout` and
  `bodyTimeout` are 300 s, so any non-streaming completion slower than that died
  as a bare `request failed (fetch failed)` — before the
  `CLAWPATCH_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS` deadline could fire, which made raising that
  timeout past 300 s a no-op (pr-reviewer's structural lane lost ~1 in 4 passes
  this way at 300–330 s, regardless of diff size). The gateway call now uses
  undici's own `fetch` with an Agent whose timeouts match the deadline; the
  deadline stays the single clock that ends a call. (An npm undici Agent handed
  to Node 22's built-in fetch as `dispatcher` fails every request, so it is
  undici's fetch, not the built-in one.) A replaced global `fetch` (test stubs,
  embedders) is still used as-is. New dependency: `undici` ^8 (Node >= 22.19).
- **provider(gateway)**: a transport failure names its cause —
  `fetch failed: UND_ERR_SOCKET other side closed`, `…UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT…`,
  `…ECONNREFUSED…` — instead of every failure reading `fetch failed`.

### 0.6.3 - Unreleased (protoLabs fork)

- **provider**: `extractJson` recovers an answer wrapped in junk that balances
  with it. `protolabs/smart` intermittently opens a structured reply with a
  doubled brace (`{{"findings":…}})`, sometimes `{"{"findings":…`); the
  balanced-brace scan skipped past the whole failed span and never tried the
  valid object one character in, so the reply failed as
  `response was not parseable JSON` (exit `4`) and the retry usually hit the same
  shape. A second, descending scan now runs only when no top-level candidate
  parses, so a draft object nested in a malformed preamble still never beats the
  answer after it. All 25 captured live failures parse (36 findings recovered).

### 0.6.2 - Unreleased (protoLabs fork)

- **provider(gateway)**: an unusable model reply is reported for what it is.
  A reply cut off at the output limit (`finish_reason: "length"`) fails with
  `response truncated at the output limit` instead of
  `response was not parseable JSON`, and every unusable-reply error carries
  `finish_reason` and token usage (`completion_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens`,
  `prompt_tokens`). Exit code (`4`) and error class (`provider-failure`) are
  unchanged.
- **provider(gateway)**: empty and unparseable replies are retried within
  `CLAWPATCH_REVIEW_RETRIES`; before this, a gateway failure was never
  retried. A truncated reply is not retried (the same cap cuts it off again).
  `CLAWPATCH_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS` now bounds a review call with its retries,
  and a retry is only made when the time left covers another attempt as long
  as the failed one, so a caller that sizes its budget from the timeout is
  never overrun by a retry.
- **provider(gateway)**: a reply of the wrong shape (exit `8`) follows the
  same time rule, and a retry cut off by the deadline reports the failure that
  prompted it (its own class and exit code) rather than the timeout.
- **provider(gateway)**: the full raw response of a failed reply is saved to
  `<state-dir>/provider-failures/` (newest 20 kept). The error names the file
  first and ends with the failure and its figures, so both survive a caller
  that keeps only the tail of stderr.
- **provider(gateway)**: new `CLAWPATCH_GATEWAY_MAX_TOKENS` sends an explicit
  `max_tokens`. Unset by default, so request bodies are unchanged; an invalid
  value is ignored with a warning.
- **provider(gateway)**: a 2xx body that is not JSON is a `provider-failure`
  (exit `4`) instead of an uncaught `SyntaxError`.
- **provider**: `extractJson` looks past a `<think>…</think>` block that
  starts the reply, so a reasoning preamble with a stray `{` no longer hides
  valid JSON. A reply that is valid JSON as a whole is always taken as-is.

### 0.6.1 - Unreleased (protoLabs fork)

- **provider**: added `proto` — drives the protoCLI agent
  (`@protolabsai/proto`) over ACP via acpx's `--agent` escape hatch. Same
  JSON-schema mechanics as the existing acpx provider, but uses
  `acpx --agent "proto --acp -m <model>"` so we don't need acpx to ship
  a `proto` subcommand upstream. Auth flows through protoCLI's
  `--openai-base-url` / `--openai-api-key` env (typically set to the
  LiteLLM gateway in deployed environments).
- Env knobs:
  `CLAWPATCH_PROTO_MODEL` default `protolabs/reasoning`
  `CLAWPATCH_PROTO_TIMEOUT_MS` default 300000 (5 min);
  `CLAWPATCH_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_MS` is the
  cross-provider fallback if proto-specific
  is unset
- `check()` validates both `acpx --version` AND `proto --version` so
  `clawpatch doctor` catches missing-CLI bootstrap failures explicitly.

### 0.5.0 - Unreleased (protoLabs fork)

- **fork**: protoLabs took ownership 2026-05-24. Package renamed to
  `@protolabsai/protopatch` on npm. Install via
  `pnpm add -g @protolabsai/protopatch` (or
  `pnpm add -g github:protoLabsAI/protoPatch` direct from this repo).
- **provider**: added `gateway` — POSTs the assembled prompt to any
  OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint with structured outputs
  (`response_format: json_schema`). No CLI subprocess; no auth handshake.
  Designed for the protoLabs LiteLLM gateway but works against any
  OpenAI-compatible server (vanilla OpenAI, vLLM, LM Studio, Ollama with the
  OpenAI shim). Env: `GATEWAY_API_KEY` (or `OPENAI_API_KEY`), `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
  (default `https://api.proto-labs.ai/v1`), `CLAWPATCH_GATEWAY_MODEL`
  (default `protolabs/smart`), `CLAWPATCH_GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 300000).
  See [`docs/providers.md`](docs/providers.md#gateway).
- **bin**: `protopatch` added as an alias alongside `clawpatch` — both
  resolve to the same CLI entry. Useful when the upstream `clawpatch` is
  also on PATH (e.g., during the migration window).

### 0.4.1 - Unreleased

## 0.4.0 - 2026-05-22

- Added `clawpatch ci` to initialize, map, review, write a report, and append a GitHub Actions step summary in one CI-friendly command.
- Added `clawpatch open-pr --patch <id>` to turn an applied patch attempt into an explicit GitHub pull request.

- Added retries for transient acpx JSON review failures via `--prompt-retries` and `CLAWPATCH_REVIEW_RETRIES`, thanks @coletebou.
- Hardened review ingestion so provider findings must cite included files with valid line ranges and matching evidence quotes.
- Fixed provider review to preserve valid sibling findings when per-finding schema or evidence validation fails, recording drops in `run.errors` as non-fatal `schema-drop` or `validation-drop` entries, thanks @coletebou.
- Improved provider schema validation failures so `run.errors[].message` shows compact one-line Zod issue summaries, thanks @coletebou.
- Added `total` and `results` aliases on `clawpatch report --json` output while keeping the legacy `findings` count, thanks @coletebou.
- Fixed `clawpatch open-pr` so repositories without default-branch metadata use a dedicated patch branch and let GitHub choose the PR base.
- Fixed `clawpatch open-pr` retries to push the recorded patch commit instead of any later local branch tip.
- Fixed first-time `clawpatch open-pr` branch creation to start from the recorded patch base.
- Fixed command execution so providers that exit before reading stdin do not surface benign `EPIPE` errors.
- Fixed `clawpatch ci --since` empty-review output so it reports `reviewed: 0`.
- Fixed formatter configuration so `oxfmt` uses two-space indentation consistently across platforms.
- Added generic package-less monorepo app-root mapping for Node/Next projects under roots such as `apps/*` and `packages/*` when positive source or framework signals are present.
- Added Maven project mapping for root, nested, and multi-module Java/Kotlin projects with Spring role slices, Maven validation defaults, and `pom.xml` detection, thanks @julianshess.
- Added a release-prep checklist for auditing changelog, package metadata, and dry-run package contents without publishing.
- Improved bounded source grouping so large flat directories split repeated filename families like command, plugin, doctor, and runtime files into more coherent review slices.
- Fixed acpx provider error reporting by reading the terminal `result.stopReason` envelope and surfacing non-`end_turn` reasons as typed `ClawpatchError` codes (`agent-cancelled`, `agent-refused`, `agent-truncated`) instead of opaque `malformed-output`, thanks @coletebou.
- Added website crawler artifacts and a static smoke check for metadata, anchors, and social-card dimensions, thanks @zack-dev-cm.
- Improved OpenCode malformed JSON diagnostics with output length, event kinds, and a bounded preview, thanks @rohitjavvadi.

- Fixed Bun package-manager detection to recognize the text `bun.lock` lockfile, thanks @austinm911.
- Fixed review-output schema to tolerate optional `reproduction` and `minimumFixScope` fields and zero-valued evidence line numbers (normalized to `null`), recovering 4 of 28 zod issue patterns observed in run `20260517T190759-3c9e9e` (78 errors over 1000 features) that previously dropped whole-feature output instead of the affected finding.
- Changed `clawpatch review --jobs` and `clawpatch ci --jobs` defaults from a fixed `10` to `floor(cpuCores / 2)` clamped to `[1, 10]`, thanks @coletebou.
- Added `clawpatch review --rate-limit-per-minute <n>` (also `CLAWPATCH_RPM`) to cap how many provider calls may start within any rolling 60s window across jobs, thanks @coletebou.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-05-18

- Added explicit Codex reasoning effort selection via `--reasoning-effort`, `CLAWPATCH_REASONING_EFFORT`, and provider config, with `doctor` reporting the active setting.
- Added `CLAWPATCH_CODEX_SANDBOX` for overriding Codex provider sandbox mode when the host already provides isolation, thanks @IAMSamuelRodda.
- Added `clawpatch review --prompt-file` to append extra reviewer guidance from a file or stdin, thanks @dpdanpittman.

- Added deterministic Express, Fastify, and Hono route mapping for Node projects, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Fixed Express route mapping to recognize aliased Router factories from imports, CommonJS destructuring, and direct assignments, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Added conservative Django `urls.py` route mapping for `path`, `re_path`, and legacy `url` declarations, thanks @rohitjavvadi.
- Added first-pass Elixir Mix/Phoenix mapping for project metadata, contexts, Phoenix web slices, runtime config, Ecto migrations, project scripts, ExUnit tests, and Mix validation defaults, thanks @tears-mysthrala.

- Fixed .NET mapping to avoid including `NuGet.config` in review context and to reject stale or commented solution project entries when choosing validation defaults.
- Improved Node workspace mapping with richer package overview features, generic extension package context, semantic large-source splits, and stricter generated/build ownership hygiene.
- Fixed agent mapper inventory to honor Git ignored files, nested worktrees, and configured include/exclude filters, thanks @amiable-dev.
- Fixed provider commands with relative `--root` paths by canonicalizing explicit roots before invoking Codex or other providers.
- Improved Codex provider failures for missing Responses API write scope with direct credential and scope guidance.
- Improved `clawpatch fix` handoff context and patch-attempt changed-file auditing for dirty-worktree fixes.

- Fixed agent mapping so provider-derived slices augment deterministic slices instead of retiring useful heuristic coverage on large repos.
- Fixed ACPX provider calls so stalled child agents time out instead of hanging indefinitely.
- Improved `clawpatch map` progress output and Rust mapping latency by reporting mapper activity on stderr and avoiding repeated Rust test discovery walks, thanks @optozorax.
